        1- process raw data from toolbox
        2- add Temp 
3- hyper parameters tunning -> find the optimum model (LOOCV)
4- test different window length, test different frequencies of AX3 (50, 10, 1, 0.1)
        5- apply optimum model on unseen data (days in home) -> prediction
6- compare metircs  -> 
    (Sleep summary measures (TST, WASO, ...) by (Sleep diary, AWS, Biobank, our model) and  
    Epoch-by-epoch concordance (accuracy, F1, recall, specificity, Cohen's Kappa))
7- visualisation to compare all sources (Sleep diary, AWS, Biobank, our model)
