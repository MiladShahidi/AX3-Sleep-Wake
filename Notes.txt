About non-wear:

Non-wear is not observed ground truth. It's inferred by the toolbox (https://github.com/OxWearables/biobankAccelerometerAnalysis/tree/master)
For training our models, we solely rely on our own ground truth labels (PSG). Even if the toolbox detects non-wear, PSG labels are more reliable.

When predicting on non-labelled epochs however, and since we want to compare our performance to the toolbox, we need to remove those epochs for which
the toolbox makes no prediction, i.e. (inferred) non-wear epochs.
